# UFOs
## Overview: 
In the this project we worked on making a more in dpth analysis of the UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time.
In addition to the date we had to ad filters for the city, state, country and shape.

### Results:
The way to use this interface will be by doing so in the bulletin below.
  - First you are able to use the filter by country which would allow you to see a large spectrum of data.

  - Then adjust the date for the date specific encounter or time period the search is for.

  - You are then to use this by then adjusting the state to make the search more specified.

  - To then make this a more area specific search you can add the city to really pinpoint if there are sightings.

  - The final adjustment you can make is from the shape of the UFO. There are a multitude of shapes to look up.

 ### Summary:
 
  - In this webpage there are a couple of drawbacks. The first would be that the country filter is not usable since there is no other country to search from.
  - The other is that the data from the comments are messy and not cleaned up at all.
  - The recommendations I would have would be that there would be drop drown options for some of the filters such as the shape since they would be difficult to look up.
  - I would have also added in the Duration time in the filter as a drop down to find if there were any occurence in different zones that would be able to be tracked this way if     there is a phenomenon nation wide or if it is location relative.
